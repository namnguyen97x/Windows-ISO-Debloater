## ⚙️ Technical Details

### ISO Generation Tool

The script utilizes `oscdimg.exe`, a Microsoft tool for creating bootable ISO images. During execution, the script automatically downloads `oscdimg.exe` directly from Microsoft's servers and uses it to generate the modified ISO.

For those who prefer to use their own copy of oscdimg.exe:

1. Download the "Windows ADK" from [Microsoft's official site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install)
2. During installation, select only the "Deployment Tools" component
3. Navigate to: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\amd64\Oscdimg`
4. Check if `oscdimg.exe` is installed properly

### ISO Generation Methods

The script supports two methods for creating the final ISO file:

#### 1. Oscdimg Method (Default)

By default, the script uses `oscdimg.exe`, to create bootable ISO images
- Downloads automatically if not present
- Creates highly compatible ISO files
- Recommended for most users

To use this method (default):
```powershell
.\isoDebloaterScript.ps1 -useOscdimg yes
```

#### 2. IMAPI2FS Method (Alternative)

An alternative ISO generation method using the [IMAPI2FS interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_imapi/)
- Uses native Windows COM objects without external dependencies
- Creates bootable ISOs directly through Windows COM interfaces
- May work in environments where oscdimg has issues

To use this method:
```powershell
.\isoDebloaterScript.ps1 -useOscdimg no
```

⚠️ **Note**: The IMAPI2FS method is still considered experimental and may not work in all environments.

## 📊 What Gets Removed?

The script can remove various components based on preferences, including:

- **Pre-installed Bloats**: Candy Crush, Disney+, Spotify, TikTok, etc.
- **Microsoft Apps**: OneDrive, Skype, Teams, Office installers, Edge (optional)
- **System Components**: Windows Media Player, Windows Fax and Scan, etc.
- **Features**: Telemetry services, unnecessary language packs, etc.
